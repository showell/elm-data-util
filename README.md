This project gives you simple wrappers and
examples for using Elm.CodeGen.

If you want to use Elm.CodeGen to generate
Elm code, you may be slightly overwhelmed by
its API.  (The API is actually quite nice,
but it covers a lot.)

This package aims to provide simple
examples like "factorial" to guide you
on the process.

It is very early stages!!!!

Contributions are welcome.  I am usually on
Slack (@showell).

(many thanks to Rupert Smith for his helpful
advice in getting me started, and of course
much thanks to all the folks behind the
modules I'm wrapping here)
