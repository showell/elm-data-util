This project helps you parser JSON into a custom type
with things like DFloat, DInt, and DList.

It is very early stages!!!!

The eventual goal is to help you generate Elm code
from JSON payloads.  It will read the data, infer the
structure, and generate sample code for things like
decoders.

It is intended as a DEVELOPMENT TOOL ONLY.
